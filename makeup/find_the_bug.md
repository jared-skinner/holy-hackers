# Find the Bug

A lesson on debugging.  I am shooting for 30-60 mins

## Goals

* Be able to describe what a bug is
* Be able to describe what debugging is
* Develop some basic experience of what debugging is

## Lesson

* I will have a stack of programs written if pseudo python (Kolbe Script).  Each program will have a bug in it (or more than one).
* I will have a master key as well which highlights the bug.
* One kids will be given the master key and have to figure out what to do.
* The kids will act it out
* The program without highlighting will be provided to the group
* The other kids will guess where the bug is
