# Conditional Commander

This will be a small game to break up the day.  I am targeting 15 minutes.

## Goals

* Learn how common programming operations are used
  * for loops
  * while loops
  * if then
  * case
  * break

## Lesson

* Have kids line up
* Call out instructions for the kids to do.
* Say start for them to run the program
* Examples:
  * if the sky is blue, then jump else clap once
  * while true hop on one foot
  * if mr skinner has a beard, then touch a finger to your nose, else sit down
