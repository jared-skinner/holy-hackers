# Black Box

This is a game focused on training kids to think about functions.  Targeting 30-60 minutes.

## Goals

* Understand what a function is
* Understand function arguments
* Develop an understanding of what a function is capable of doing

## Lesson

* Explain the rules:

  * Kids pair off
  * Pairs are given a few pieces of paper
  * Each piece of paper is a function
  * One one side of the piece of paper the following information needs to be given:
    * A name
    * A list of arguments (with types)
    * A return type
  * On the other side of the paper instructions should be written out for what the function does

* Once everyone has created their functions...
  * The pairs will take turns holding up their paper so everyone can see the function signature
  * Each person will have a chance to provide an input to the function 
  * We will guess what the function does

* Kids are encouraged to be tricky!

* We will keep score
