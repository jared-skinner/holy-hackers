### Firefly

### Game Pad


## Games

### Baba is You

### Baba is You (Live)

### Condition Commanders

**Goal** Practice conditions

**Objective:** Be the last one "standing" (or in this case, running!)

**Setup:**

2. Select one player to be the "Commander" who will call out the commands, and all the other players will respond to these commands.

1. Define a clear play area with boundaries, like a large square or rectangle in an open space. All players, except for the Commander, start within this area.

**Game Play:**

1. The Commander will call out conditions in an "if/then" format, for example, "If I say 'Go', then run to the right boundary". Players must listen carefully and perform the action when the condition is met.

2. Add complexity by including "while" conditions. For example, "While I'm jumping, run in a circle" or "While I'm clapping, hop on one foot".

3. If a player does the wrong action or does not do the action when the condition is met, they are "out" and must sit on the side.

4. The game continues until only one player is left. This player becomes the new "Commander" for the next round.
